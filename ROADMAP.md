# HabitHero™

_Unleash Your Inner Hero, One Habit at a Time_

<hr>

There is a lot I wish I could have gotten to, but due to the time constraint, I prioritized main functionality and building a UI optimized for the browser. I would definitely go back and refactor the code to be more uniform, such as changing `px` to `rem`, standardizing all CSS to Tailwind variables and ordering imports in the same way with an ESLint rule. I also wish I could have implemented additional database schemas and API functionality. I am confident that with more time I would have been able to implement the other types of Records.

Overall, I'm very proud of this application, as I have never worked with Prisma and GraphQL prior and yet I was able to create a working prototype. I also see that my frontend skills have greatly improved, as I have learned which technologies are industry standard and are best to use.

With that being said, I compiled a list of tasks I would continue to work on if I had more time!

### Nice to Haves
In the future, I would like to tackle this list of functionality for the project:
- [ ] Server Side Rendering optimization on the frontend
- [ ] Fix babel config Jest error
- [ ] Refactor reusable components such as `<Button/>` to external Storybook UI-Library
- [ ] Refactor CSS to use all TW vars, and px to rem
- [ ] Visual regression testing for UI-Library
- [ ] Implement additional Objects in the backend such as `Referral`, `Action`, `PlayerAction`, `Reward`, `PlayerReward`,`ActionRequirement`
- [ ] Create database relationships, such as one:many (`Player`:`PlayerAction`) and one:one (`Player`:`Player` via a `Referral`)
- [ ] Create additional frontend pages to track habits, earn rewards, refer other Players
- [ ] Light mode + Dark mode and other frontend accessibility features
- [ ] Automatic build pipeline and `main` and `dev` branches with protections in Github
- [ ] Deploy application to Vercel
