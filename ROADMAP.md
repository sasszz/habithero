### 🚀 Project Roadmap

Our HabitHero™ project is divided into several milestones to ensure we stay on track and deliver a high-quality habit-tracking app. Below is an outline of our progress and future goals, as we build a powerful tool for users to track, maintain, and be rewarded for their daily habits.

### Nice to Haves
In the future, I would like to tackle this list of functionality for the project:
- [ ] Server Side Rendering optimization on the frontend
- [ ] Refactor reusable components such as `<Button/>` to external Storybook UI-Library
- [ ] Visual regression testing for UI-Library
- [ ] Implement additional Objects in the backend such as `Referral`, `Action`, `PlayerAction`, `Reward`, `PlayerReward`,`ActionRequirement`
- [ ] Create database relationships, such as one:many (`Player`:`PlayerAction`) and one:one (`Player`:`Player` via a `Referral`)
- [ ] Create additional frontend pages to track habits, earn rewards, refer other Players
- [ ] Light mode + Dark mode and other frontend accessibility features
- [ ] Automatic build pipeline and `main` and `dev` branches with protections in Github
- [ ] Deploy application to Vercel
