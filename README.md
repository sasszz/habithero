### Frontend Exercise

```
TIMEBOX:    2-3 hours max. We mean it!
LANGUAGES:  Javascript/Typescript
FRAMEWORKS: React and any libraries you want
TESTS:      nice to have, but not mandatory
DOCS:       nice to have, but not mandatory
```

Implement the following design in the Figma file using [React](https://reactjs.org/) consuming the API. Feel free to implement using any techniques you feel are appropriate.

### Backend Exercise

```
TIMEBOX:    2-4 hours max. We mean it! Set at timer and hard-stop at 4 hours ‚è±
LANGUAGES:  Typescript
FRAMEWORKS: Express, Apollo, NodeJS, etc
TESTS:      nice to have, but not mandatory
DOCS:       nice to have, but not mandatory
```

Create a public GraphQL API using [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

In the backend folder you will find a NodeJS project preconfigured with database models using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM.

`./backend/db/prisma/schema.prisma`

The database models consist of a:

- [Player] A record for a user that has signed up
- [Action] A type of "action" a player can perform
- [Reward] A reward granted to user for performing specific actions
- [ActionRequirement] The action(s) required for a reward to be granted
- [PlayerAction] A record of actions the player has performed
- [PlayerReward] A record of rewards the player has been granted

Run the seed file to populate the database.

`npm run prisma:seed`

#### The task:

- Create a `Mutation` for signing up a `Player` by `email`.
- Create a `Query` for returning the fields required by the application for `Player` by `email`.
- The player should return an additional `score` field which is the cumulative score of their rewards

What a user signs up the following should happen:

- A `Player` is created
- Record a `PlayerAction` that the player has performed the `PLAYER_SIGNUP` action
- Determine if the `Player` can be granted any rewards based on the action and create a `PlayerReward` record
